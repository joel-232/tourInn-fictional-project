# tourInn-fictional-project
Thid is a fictional project made for learning purposes.
The website consist of 5 sections which are wrapped up into a single page. I have used html,css and javascript for this project.
This website has the basic structure using html and css. The use of javascript was for the navigation scroll into view animation, and for the text animation.
